The quiz can feature **multiple-choice, true/false, or fill-in-the-blank** questions. Users receive instant feedback on their answers, and a progress tracker keeps them engaged. Timer-based quizzes add an extra challenge, while JavaScript ensures seamless transitions between questions. 

Advanced features like **randomized questions, score tracking, and leaderboard integration** can enhance user experience. The quiz can be embedded on websites for educational purposes, online assessments, or entertainment. Itâ€™s lightweight, fast, and customizable, making it an excellent tool for learning and engagement.
